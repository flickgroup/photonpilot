# PhotonPilot

## Description

Welcome to PhotonPilot. This repository holds the code for generating cavity coupling parameters for simple layered cavities. 

The code currently supports
* Fabry Perot cavities
* Spherical cavities

## Installation
The package can be used to simply adding PhotonPilot 
to your python path. On UNIX systems it should be as simple
as adding the following to your .bashrc or .bash_profile

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:\<path-to-photonpilot>"
